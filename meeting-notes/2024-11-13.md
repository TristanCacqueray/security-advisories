https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/blob/main/meeting-notes/2024-10-30.md

## Q3(+) report

The report is proposed: [#244](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/pull/244). We will reproduce it on Discourse tomorrow, and submit a PR to update https://www.haskell.org/security/.

## SRT Process

We should document more thoroughly the SRT processes
(administrative), particularly since we went through our first
vacancy->new appointments cycle.

## GHC Math bugs

The advisories are updated and available for review: [#214](https://github.com/haskell/security-advisories/pull/214)

## flora integration

[flora](https://github.com/flora-pm/flora-server/) has pinged Gautier and Fraser
regarding [security advisories integration PR#762](https://github.com/flora-pm/flora-server/pull/762).

After a discussion between Gautier and Hecate (the maintainer), flora will
integrate advisories search and the decision was made to replicate the advisories
structure in PostGreSQL.

Perhaps we should recommend to use the OSV export?
